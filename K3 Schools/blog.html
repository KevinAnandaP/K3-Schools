            <h2>What Is Programming?</h2>
            <p>What comes to your mind when you hear the word "programming"? coding? Or computing? It's still wrong. Hemm, it would be nice if we started from the basics first. Programming is a program.

                What's the program like? A program is a logical sequence with certain inputs and outputs. Programs can also be in the form of a collection of commands so that the computer can function optimally as desired. Programs that are integrated with the system are called applications, such as web applications or Android.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You are still wondering, what is programming? It's simple, programming is a process of making programs on a computer. The program created can be in the form of software, website, android application, etc.

                Then, where to start so you can start programming? To create a program, of course, there are several stages. Starting from writing, testing, revising and evaluating, and testing it again until the program is actually finished and according to what is desired.
                
                So, programming is a process or activity of writing and testing (programming) so that programs can be made, and the results are what you want.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How, have you started to understand what programming is?

                Then, another question arises about programming. What is written in the process? Of course, not ordinary writing. It's not like writing novels or poetry because this is related to computer programs. So that the written language must also be understandable by computers, namely in the form of pre-existing program codes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That is why a programming expert must master programming languages.

                Currently, many new programming languages have emerged. This happened because someone tried to simplify and facilitate existing programming languages. The goal is to make the program much faster, more effective and as simple as possible.</p>
